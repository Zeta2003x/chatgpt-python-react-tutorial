React Topic: Pure Functions

Problem:
One of the challenges in developing complex applications is managing the state and ensuring predictable behavior. Traditional state management techniques can lead to unexpected bugs, as it becomes difficult to track the changes made to the application's state. Additionally, sharing and reusing code can become problematic due to side effects caused by mutating shared data.

Solution: 
React introduces the concept of pure functions as a solution to these problems. Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and do not have any side effects. They do not modify the input data or modify anything outside their own scope. By utilizing pure functions, React provides a clear and predictable approach to state management and enables the seamless sharing of code.

Example in Code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Example of a pure function component
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
}

// Example of a pure function
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Usage of the Greeting component and calculateSum function
function App() {
  const sum = calculateSum(2, 3);
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="John" />
      <p>Sum: {sum}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the code snippet above, we have two examples of pure functions using React. 

1. `Greeting`: This is a pure function component that takes a prop `name` and returns a JSX element displaying a greeting message with the given name. It only renders UI based on the provided input and does not modify any external state. 

2. `calculateSum`: This is a pure function that takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input and returns their sum. It does not modify the input parameters or have any external side effects. It only produces the expected output for the given inputs.

By using pure functions in React, we ensure that the components and functions are predictable, easy to test, and don't exhibit unwanted side effects, leading to more maintainable and bug-free code.
