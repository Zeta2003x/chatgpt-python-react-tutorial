Lifting state up is a concept in React that solves the problem of sharing and synchronizing data between multiple components. In React, components are meant to be modular and reusable, but sometimes there is a need for multiple components to access and manipulate the same piece of data. This is where lifting state up comes into play.

The problem:
In a typical React application, each component manages its own state, which means that data is encapsulated within the component and is not directly accessible to other components. However, there are scenarios where data needs to be shared across multiple components, such as when two or more components need to display and update the same piece of information.

For example, consider a simple application that has a parent component called "App" and two child components called "Counter" and "Controls". The "Counter" component displays a count value, and the "Controls" component provides buttons to increment and decrement the count. The goal is to allow both components to access and update the same count value.

The solution: Lifting state up
The concept of lifting state up suggests that the shared state should be lifted up to a common parent component that can control and distribute the state to its child components. By doing so, the parent component becomes the "single source of truth" for the shared state, allowing it to be accessed and modified by all child components.

To implement lifting state up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the shared state: Determine the data that needs to be shared among multiple components. In our example, it is the count value.

2. Decide on the parent component: Choose a parent component that will control the shared state. In our example, it is the "App" component.

3. Lift state to the parent component: Move the state from the child component(s) to the parent component, creating a single source of truth for the shared state. In our example, we will move the count state from the "Counter" component to the "App" component.

4. Pass the state as props: Pass the shared state from the parent component to its children as props. In our example, the "Counter" component will receive the count value as a prop.

5. Handle state updates: Implement handler functions in the parent component to modify the shared state. In our example, the "Controls" component will call these handler functions to increment or decrement the count value.

Example in code:
Let's take a look at an example of lifting state up in the context of our counter application.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <Controls
        increment={incrementCount}
        decrement={decrementCount}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

function Controls({ increment, decrement }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the state (count) is lifted up from the "Counter" component to the "App" component. The "App" component holds the count state and defines the incrementCount and decrementCount handler functions. The count state is then passed as a prop to the "Counter" component, which displays it. The "Controls" component, also a child of "App", receives the increment and decrement functions as props and triggers them when the respective buttons are clicked.

This way, the count value is shared and synchronized among the "Counter" and "Controls" components. Any changes to the count in either component will be reflected in the other.
