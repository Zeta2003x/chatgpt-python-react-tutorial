Topic: React DOM

React DOM is a module in the React library that focuses on the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) in web browsers. It enables developers to efficiently render components and update the DOM in response to changes in the application's state.

The Problem it Solves:
Traditional web development involves directly manipulating the DOM, which can be a cumbersome and inefficient process. Manually updating the DOM to reflect changes in the application's state can lead to performance issues and complex code management. Additionally, it can be challenging to track and efficiently update only the necessary components.

React DOM provides a solution to these challenges by abstracting away direct DOM manipulation. It facilitates a declarative approach to building user interfaces, where developers define how the UI should look for a given state, and React handles efficiently updating the DOM to reflect those changes.

Example in Code:

Let's consider a basic example that demonstrates the usage of React DOM. Suppose we have an application with a counter displaying the number of times a button has been clicked.

1. Install React and ReactDOM:

```bash
$ npm install react react-dom
```

2. Create a basic HTML file (index.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>React DOM Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Create a JavaScript file (index.js) that will contain our React code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Create a Counter component
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  // Event handler for button click
  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1,
    }));
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Counter: {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Render the Counter component using React DOM
ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example, we define a `Counter` component that initializes a `count` state to 0. Whenever the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is
