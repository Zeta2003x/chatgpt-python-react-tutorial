React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is known for its component-based architecture, which allows developers to create reusable UI elements. One important concept in React is array immutability, which helps improve code predictability and performance.

The problem that array immutability solves is related to the way JavaScript handles objects, including arrays. In JavaScript, objects are mutable by default, which means they can be changed directly. This can lead to unexpected behaviors and bugs in React applications.

When working with arrays in React, mutations can cause issues such as unintended component re-renders and confusing program state. React relies on efficient comparison algorithms to determine when to update the DOM, and mutable arrays can make this process more complex and prone to errors. Additionally, managing state becomes challenging when multiple components rely on the same array or when undo/redo functionality is needed.

The solution to this problem is to use array immutability, which means not modifying the original array but instead creating a new array with the desired changes. This allows React to efficiently compare the old and new arrays, making the reconciliation process simpler and more reliable.

Let's take a look at an example of array immutability using JavaScript and React:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn React', completed: false },
    { id: 2, text: 'Build an app', completed: false },
  ]);

  const markTodoComplete = (id) => {
    setTodos((prevTodos) => {
      // Creating a new array with the updated completed property
      const updatedTodos = prevTodos.map((todo) => {
        if (todo.id === id) {
          return {
            ...todo,
            completed: true,
          };
        }
        return todo;
      });
      return updatedTodos;
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>
            {todo.text}{' '}
            {!todo.completed && (
              <button onClick={() => markTodoComplete(todo.id)}>
                Mark as Completed
              </button>
            )}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Example;
```

In this example, we have a simple todo list component. The `todos` state is initialized with an array of todo objects, each having unique `id`, `text`, and `completed` properties.

When the "Mark as Completed" button is clicked, the `markTodoComplete` function is called. Instead of directly modifying the `todos` array, we use the `setTodos` function provided by React's `useState` hook. This function takes a callback that receives the previous state (`prevTodos`) and returns the new state.

Inside the callback, we create a new array `updatedTodos` by mapping over the previous todos. When we find the todo with the matching `id`, we create a new object using the spread operator (`...`) to copy all the properties of the original todo and change the `completed` property to `true`. For all other todos, we return the original todo object unchanged.

Finally, the `setTodos` function is called with `updatedTodos`, updating the component's state and triggering a re-render of the UI. React will efficiently compare the old and new arrays, update only the necessary parts of the DOM, and keep the UI in sync with the state.

By using array immutability, React can accurately track and optimize the rendering process, leading to improved performance and fewer bugs. It also helps with writing more maintainable code as mutations are avoided, making the behavior of the program more predictable.

In conclusion, array immutability is an essential concept in React that solves common problems related
