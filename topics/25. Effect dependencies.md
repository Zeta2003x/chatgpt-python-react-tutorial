React is a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. One of its most powerful features is the ability to manage state and side effects through hooks, including the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook allows developers to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, and updating the DOM. However, it also introduces the problem of managing dependencies between effects, which can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.

The problem of effect dependencies arises when one effect relies on the results of another effect or when their execution order is crucial. Let's consider an example where an application fetches user information from an API and logs it to the console, and another effect is responsible for updating the user's profile picture whenever the user updates their profile.

First, let's define a functional component that retrieves user information and logs it:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const UserComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
      const data = await response.json();
      setUser(data);
    };

    fetchUser();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      console.log(`User information: ${user.name}`);
    }
  }, [user]);

  return <div>{user ? user.name : 'Loading...'}</div>;
};

export default UserComponent;
```

In the above code, we have two effects. The first effect is responsible for fetching user information and storing it in the `user` state variable. The second effect logs the user's name to the console whenever the `user` state changes.

Next, let's introduce a new requirement where the application needs to update the user's profile picture whenever the user updates their profile. We can modify the component as follows:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const UserComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
      const data = await response.json();
      setUser(data);
    };

    fetchUser();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      console.log(`User information: ${user.name}`);
    }
  }, [user]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user && user.profilePicture) {
      console.log('Updating profile picture...');
      // Logic to update the profile picture
    }
  }, [user]);

  return <div>{user ? user.name : 'Loading...'}</div>;
};

export default UserComponent;
```

In this updated code, we added a third effect that executes whenever the `user` state changes, checking if the user has a `profilePicture` property and updating it if necessary. However, there is a potential problem with the current implementation because the second effect that logs the user information to the console also depends on the `user` state.

If the user updates their profile, the second effect will execute before the third effect, resulting in incorrect log outputs. This happens because React batches the state updates within a single render cycle, and the second effect sees the old `user` state before it is updated by the third effect.

To solve this problem, we can split the logic of the second effect into a separate effect that specifically listens for changes in the `user` state.
