React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for web applications. One of its core features is the ability to handle state changes efficiently. In this topic, we will explore how React solves the problem of conditional state changes and provide an example in code.

The Problem:
In many applications, the state of components needs to be modified based on certain conditions or user interactions. For instance, imagine a login form where a user enters their credentials. When the user submits the form, the component should display an error message if the login credentials are incorrect, or navigate to the home page if the credentials are valid. Handling such conditional state changes can be complex and error-prone, especially as the application grows in size.

Solution:
React provides a simple and powerful solution to handle conditional state changes through its built-in state management system. By encapsulating both the data and the behavior within components, React enables developers to declaratively define the desired state and updates accordingly. This allows for a more intuitive and manageable approach to handling conditional state changes.

Example in Code:
Let's consider a simple React component that represents a toggle button with an associated message. The goal is to change the message when the button is clicked, alternating between "On" and "Off".

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ToggleButton() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setIsOn(prevState => !prevState);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        {isOn ? 'On' : 'Off'}
      </button>
      <p>{isOn ? 'The button is on' : 'The button is off'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the code snippet above, we import the `useState` hook from React, which allows us to define and update the component's state. We use the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable `isOn` with an initial value of `false`. The `setIsOn` function is a mechanism provided by React to update the state when needed.

Inside the `handleClick` function, we call `setIsOn` with a new state value, toggling the boolean value of `isOn`. By using a function inside `setIsOn`, we ensure that the state update is based on the previous state value. This avoids any race conditions that might occur due to React's asynchronous nature and ensures correct state changes.

Finally, in the component's return statement, we render a button element with an `onClick` event listener assigned to `handleClick`. The text content of the button is determined by the current value of `isOn`, displaying either "On" or "Off". Additionally, we render a paragraph element that displays a corresponding message based on the state value.

This simple example demonstrates how conditional state changes can be easily managed in React. Whenever the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called, which updates the state and triggers a re-render of the component. React intelligently handles this state change, efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the user interface.

In conclusion, React's ability to handle conditional state changes simplifies the development process and improves the maintainability of code. By utilizing React's state management system, developers can declaratively define the desired state and efficiently handle updates based on various conditions or user interactions.
