React is a popular JavaScript library that addresses the complexity of building user interfaces by providing a powerful and efficient way to create reusable components. One essential aspect of building interactive applications is handling user interactions, such as clicks, keyboard input, and other events. React simplifies this process by providing a clean and declarative approach to handling events.

The Problem:
In traditional JavaScript, event handling can become challenging as the application grows in complexity. Manually managing event listeners, dealing with event delegation, and ensuring proper event binding can quickly become complicated. Additionally, handling events in a way that doesn't introduce memory leaks or affects application performance can be tricky.

React's Solution:
React solves these problems by introducing a synthetic event system that simplifies event handling. With React, developers can write event handlers in a straightforward and declarative manner, allowing them to focus on the application's logic rather than worrying about the intricacies of event binding and handling.

Example in Code:
Let's consider an example where we have a simple button component in React. This button needs to trigger an action whenever it is clicked by the user.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Button component
const Button = () => {
  // Event handler function
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    // Perform the desired action here
  };

  // Render the button element with the onClick event handler
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
};

export default Button;
```

In the above code, we create a functional component called `Button`. Inside this component, we define an event handler function named `handleClick`. This function will be called whenever the button is clicked.

To attach the event handler to the button, we use the `onClick` prop with the value set to our `handleClick` function. This tells React that when the button is clicked, it should invoke the `handleClick` function.

When the button is clicked, the event is automatically passed as a synthetic event to the `handleClick` function. This synthetic event provides cross-browser compatibility and wraps the underlying native event object. In this example, we're simply logging a message to the console, but in a real application, you would perform the desired action inside the `handleClick` function.

React's synthetic event system abstracts away the complexities of event handling in different browsers and ensures consistent behavior across all platforms. It also simplifies the process of accessing event data and prevents common pitfalls like referring to stale event values due to event pooling.

By using React's event handling approach, developers can easily write code that is more maintainable, readable, and scalable. They can focus on building the application's logic and user experience instead of spending time dealing with low-level event handling intricacies.

In conclusion, React's event handling system solves the problem of complex and error-prone event management in vanilla JavaScript. It provides a clean and declarative way to handle events, improving developer productivity and reducing the chances of introducing bugs. The example above demonstrates how React simplifies event handling, allowing developers to write code that is clear, concise, and efficient.
